## What is Nython

Nython is a Python-like interpreted language implemented in C++20, with its own lexer, parser, bytecode compiler, and virtual machine. Version **v0.2.1**.

## Build System

### Linux (Makefile)
```bash
make cli        # Build CLI binary (SDL3 required)
make            # Build IDE binary (SDL3 required)
./build/nython-cli --ide   # Launch IDE
```

Real SDL3 is used when found (`sdl3-config`/`pkg-config`, or the usual header
paths); otherwise the Makefile falls back automatically to the headless stub
under `thirdparty/sdl3-stub/` (see "Development environment" below) — no
manual step needed either way. Install real SDL3 with:
```bash
apt install libsdl3-dev libsdl3-ttf-dev libsdl3-image-dev
```
Force one or the other with `NYTHON_SDL_STUB=1` (stub) / `=0` (real, fails
loudly if not found) if auto-detection picks the wrong one.

### Windows (Code::Blocks)
- `.cbp` is pre-configured with SDL3 include/lib paths to `C:\SDL3\`
- Link libraries: `ws2_32`, `SDL3`, `SDL3_ttf`, `SDL3_image`
- Copy `SDL3.dll`, `SDL3_ttf.dll`, `SDL3_image.dll` next to `nython.exe`
- See `SDL3_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions

### Development environment (no SDL3 available)

Most dev/CI containers have no SDL3 and can't install it. The headless stub
committed at `thirdparty/sdl3-stub/` provides the SDL/SDL_ttf/SDL_image
surface `src/builtins/gui.cpp` actually calls, so everything builds and every
GUI/IDE test runs without a display — the Makefile picks it automatically.

```bash
rm -rf build && make cli && make        # ~2-3 minutes total
cp build/nython-cli ./ny_test
NY_STUB_AUTOQUIT=120 ./build/nython --ide    # IDE runs and exits cleanly
```

`NY_STUB_AUTOQUIT=<n>` makes the stub deliver one quit event after *n* empty
polls so event loops terminate; `NY_STUB_DPI_SCALE=<f>` fakes a HiDPI display.
Full detail in `HANDOFF.md`.

### Key build flags
- `-DNYTHON_WITH_IDE=1` (default) — no-arg launch opens IDE; `=0` opens REPL
- SDL3 is unconditional — `NYTHON_HAS_SDL3` flag removed; guards removed from `gui.cpp`

## Architecture

### Builtin dispatch chain (NythonExecutor.hpp callBuiltin)
```
callBuiltin("gui_create_window", args, ctx)
  → dispatch_core()       → UNDEFINED (not handled)
  → dispatch_tensor()     → UNDEFINED
  → ...
  → dispatch_gui()        → Value(handle)  ← matches "gui_" prefix
```

Each `dispatch_*` function returns `UNDEFINED_VALUE` if it doesn't handle the name, and the chain continues to the next module.

### GUI pipeline
```
nython_ide.ny                     ← IDE application (2,110 lines)
  └── import "lib/gui.ny"        ← Widget library (12,932 lines, 150+ classes)
       ├── import nytorch         ← Registers tensor builtins (fast, no classes)
       └── calls gui_*()          ← 38 native functions
            └── src/builtins/gui.cpp  ← SDL3 always active
                 └── SDL3 API calls (SDL_CreateWindow, SDL_RenderFillRect, ...)
```

### SDL3 API usage (no OpenGL)
- `SDL_CreateWindow(title, w, h, flags)` — no x,y in constructor
- `SDL_CreateRenderer(win, NULL)` — no driver index or flags
- `SDL_FRect` (float) for all rendering, not `SDL_Rect` (int)
- `SDL_RenderLine`, `SDL_RenderPoint` — float coordinates
- `SDL_RenderTexture` replaces `SDL_RenderCopy`
- `SDL_DestroySurface` replaces `SDL_FreeSurface`
- `SDL_SetRenderVSync(ren, 1)` — replaces `SDL_RENDERER_PRESENTVSYNC`
- Event types: `SDL_EVENT_QUIT`, `SDL_EVENT_KEY_DOWN`, `SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_MOTION`, etc.
- `ev.key.key` not `ev.key.keysym.sym`
- `TTF_RenderText_Blended(font, text, 0, color)` — extra length param
- `TTF_GetStringSize(font, text, 0, &w, &h)` — replaces `TTF_SizeUTF8`
- `TTF_OpenFont(path, (float)size)` — size is float
- `IMG_Init()` not needed in SDL3_image

### Window constructor
```python
# gui.ny — Window(width, height, title)
var w = Window(1600, 960, "NythonIDE v3.0")
w.run(callback)   # callback(renderer, event) — custom render loop
```
- `x` and `y` default to `-1` (centered)
- `run(callback)` sends `"idle"` events when no SDL events (continuous redraw)
- Without SDL3: `create()` returns `false`, prints message, exits gracefully

### Event modifiers
```python
# Event class has ctrl, shift, alt booleans
if event.key == "p" and event.ctrl:
    spotlight.visible = true
```
SDL3 backend passes modifiers via `SDL_GetModState()`.

## Key Patterns & Gotchas

### Stale object files
At least one "bug" (SIGABRT) was caused by stale `.o` files. Always `make clean && make` after header changes.

### Header-only changes need forced recompile
After editing `NythonExecutor.hpp`: `touch src/main.cpp` then rebuild.

### Kwargs must be explicitly forwarded
Collecting kwargs at the call site is insufficient — they must be passed through to `callBuiltin` or they are silently dropped (e.g., `sorted(key=, reverse=)` bug).

### Closures capture by reference
Like JavaScript, closures in loops see the final value. Use factory functions for per-iteration capture:
```python
# BAD: all closures see i=4
while i < 5:
    def fn(): return i * i
    ...

# GOOD: each closure gets its own n
def make_fn(n):
    def inner(): return n * n
    return inner
```

### GarbageCollector lock bug (fixed)
Lines 77 and 228 in `GarbageCollector.cpp` had temporary locks that were immediately destroyed. Fixed to named variables (`gc_lock`, `dealloc_lock`).

### IDE import weight
`nython_ide.ny` must NOT import `"lib/nytorch.ny"` (loads 220+ classes, causes OOM). The builtins are already registered via `gui.ny`'s bare `import nytorch`.

### Widget constructor signatures
These were aligned to match how the IDE calls them:

| Widget | Constructor |
|--------|-------------|
| Window | `(width, height, title)` |
| ActivityBar | `(x, y, w, h)` + `add_item(icon, label, active)` |
| Spotlight | `(x, y, w, h)` + `add_item(label, id)` |
| AutoComplete | `(x_or_w, y=0, w=0, h=0)` — works with 1 or 4 args |
| TabBar.add_tab | `(name, filename="", path="")` — works with 1 arg |
| TextInput | `(x, y, w, h, placeholder="")` — placeholder optional |
| FileTree | `(x, y, w, h)` + `add_node(path, label, depth, expanded, type)` + `node_count` |

## Language changes since this file was written

These entries are now **fixed**; they are listed so old notes are not trusted:

- ~~C-style negative modulo~~ — now floor-modulo, `-7 % 3 == 2`, consistent with
  floor `//` on both engines.
- ~~32-bit integer overflow~~ — results were computed at full width and then
  truncated by a cast to `(int)`. `100000 * 100000` is now correct.
- `**` no longer demotes exact integers to double below 2^63.
- ~~EOF errors report `stdin:1:1`~~ — the lexer's `End` token always carried the
  right position; the parser just discarded it once it read past the last real
  token. Fixed in `Lexer::next()`/`curr()` (HANDOFF 5.6, closed).
- ~~`id()`/`hash()` as global functions~~ — registered as recognised builtins but
  never actually dispatched on either engine (`id(x)` read `undefined`/`0`
  regardless of `x`). The *method* form `obj.id()` (object protocol) already
  worked; the bare function form didn't.
- ~~VM: `//=` `**=` `&=` `|=` `^=` `<<=` `>>=`~~ — only `+= -= *= /= %=` were
  wired to an opcode; the rest silently NOP'd, so e.g. `x //= 5` replaced `x`
  with `5` (the divisor) instead of `x // 5`.
- ~~VM: `isinstance(x, list)`~~ (the bare builtin, not the string `"list"`) —
  always read `false`; only `isinstance(x, "list")` worked.
- ~~VM: `case _:`~~ — compiled as a comparison against an undefined variable
  named `_` instead of an always-match wildcard, so it never ran.
- ~~VM: `import nytorch_classes`~~ was a no-op — the native `tensor_*` ops
  were registered, but the Nython-level class library (`Tensor`, …) was never
  actually loaded, unlike on the interpreter.
- ~~VM: typed `except` / `try`/`else`~~ — only the first `except` clause was
  ever compiled, regardless of its declared type; `else` wasn't compiled at
  all. See HANDOFF 5.9.
- ~~VM: `int(s)` never raised~~ — `int("abc")` silently returned `0` instead
  of a catchable `ValueError`, and the base argument / `0x`/`0b`/`0o` prefix
  auto-detection were never implemented.

### Added

| Feature | Notes |
|---|---|
| `1..5` / `1...5` | half-open and inclusive ranges; `a..b..step` |
| `is` / `is not` | membership: `1 is int`, `1 is Object`, `c is Base` (walks the chain) |
| `import X as Y` | binds a namespace; `from "m" import n` also works |
| `catch` | alias for `except`, matching the existing `throw`/`raise` alias |
| Located errors | `file:line:column`, source line, caret — both engines, including EOF. |
| `NameError` / `ImportError` | undefined calls and missing modules were silent |
| Object protocol | `class_name`, `to_string`, `id`, `hash`, `is_a`, `instance_of`, `equals_to`, `fields`, … — both engines |
| `--profile` | real per-function counts and self/total time |
| `gui_hash_id` | native FNV-1a for immediate-mode widget identity |
| `gui_display_scale` | HiDPI content scale |

### Known limitations

- **Containers are never reclaimed by the interpreter** — see `GC_NOTES.md`.
  The VM does not have this problem (it uses `shared_ptr`).
- `len()` counts characters but `s[i]` / `s[a:b]` index bytes.
- `1.+(2, 3)` parses but evaluates to `none` — primitives have no members.
- ~~Integer `/` differs between engines~~ — **resolved (round 71)**: `/` is
  always true division (float), `//`/`\` are floor division (int) on both
  engines. See "Round 71 fixes" below.
- `generator.send()` not implemented (eager-collection architecture).
- Video builtins are stubs (need ffmpeg).
- `@property` as decorator syntax on a class method doesn't work on the VM
  (the explicit `x = property(getter)` form does) — see HANDOFF 5.9.
  Interpreter-only-correct, not yet ported.

## Session Workflow

1. **Read `HANDOFF.md`** — environment, traps, outstanding work.
2. Build (`rm -rf build && make cli && make`), copy the CLI binary to
   `./ny_test` (some GUI tests shell out to it — see HANDOFF §2). No SDL3
   install needed; `thirdparty/sdl3-stub/` is used automatically when no real
   SDL3 is found.
3. Run the full sweep on **both engines** before changing anything, so any
   failure afterwards is attributable. Grep the *output* for `N failed`, not
   just the exit code — see HANDOFF §2/§3.
4. Reproduce a defect minimally, trace it to source, fix **both engines
   together**, and add a test asserting values rather than termination.
5. Re-run the sweep and compare divergence *sets* against
   `/tmp/obuild/nython_orig`, not counts.
6. Package to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`.
7. State plainly what was not done. A green suite that hides an unadopted module
   or a one-engine feature is worse than an honest gap.

## Bug fixes — GUI & IDE audit (multi-session)

### src/builtins/gui.cpp
- **`gui_get_error()` / `gui_sdl_version()` always returned `none`**: Root cause — the `evalCall` path in `NythonExecutor.hpp` only routes through `callBuiltin` when the function is registered in `registerBuiltins()`. Unregistered `gui_*` names evaluated to `NONE_VALUE` callee and fell through to `return NONE_VALUE` without ever calling `callBuiltin`/`dispatch_gui`. Fixed by registering `gui_get_error`, `gui_sdl_version`, `gui_create_window`, `gui_load_font`, `gui_measure_text`, `gui_load_image`, `gui_poll_events`, `gui_video_time`, `gui_video_duration` in `registerBuiltins()`. Also added `evalCall` fallback for underscore-prefixed module functions.
- **`ensure_sdl_for_window()`** — removed `SDL_HINT_RENDER_DRIVER "direct3d11"` pre-init hint that caused `SDL_CreateWindow` to silently fail on systems without D3D11.
- **`SDL_WINDOW_HIGH_PIXEL_DENSITY`** removed from window flags — caused `SDL_CreateWindow` to return NULL on some Windows 11 GPU drivers.
- **Software renderer fallback** added: if default renderer fails, tries `"software"` renderer.
- Added `gui_sdl_version()` builtin — returns SDL3 runtime version string (e.g. `"3.2.4"`).
- Added `examples/check_sdl.ny` — diagnostic script to verify SDL3 DLLs and runtime.
- **Removed `SDL_VIDEODRIVER` hint** that forced wayland/x11/offscreen on Windows, preventing window creation.
- **`SDL_WINDOW_HIGH_PIXEL_DENSITY`** flag added to all windows for proper HiDPI.
- **`SDL_HINT_RENDER_DRIVER`** set per-platform (direct3d11 on Windows, metal on macOS).
- **`SDL_Quit()`** called when last window destroyed.
- **`gui_draw_text`**: removed `if(text.empty()) return` guard that skipped space characters.
- **`gui_draw_line`**: fixed thickness — was always offsetting Y (broke vertical/diagonal lines). Now offsets perpendicular to the line direction using `(-dy/len, dx/len)`.
- **`gui_poll_events` wheel**: `ev.wheel.x/y` (scroll amount) was used as cursor position. Fixed to `ev.wheel.mouse_x/y` for position. Added `SDL_MOUSEWHEEL_FLIPPED` correction.
- **`gui_load_font`**: ignored bold/italic — all fonts loaded as regular. Now accepts 4 args `(family, size, bold, italic)`, tries bold-specific font files first, then calls `TTF_SetFontStyle` for synthesis.
- **Key names lowercase + normalised**: `SDL_GetKeyName` returns `"Return"`, `"Escape"`, `"Backspace"`, `"Up"` etc. All widgets expect lowercase `"enter"`, `"escape"`, `"backspace"`, `"up"`. Key names are now lowercased and normalised (`"return"→"enter"`, `"page up"→"pageup"`, etc.) — **keyboards were completely broken before this fix**.
- **`-DNYTHON_WITH_IDE=1`** added to both Release and Debug targets in `nython.cbp`.

### lib/gui.ny
- **`Font.load()` never called**: `Font.__init__` now auto-calls `self.load()`. Added `ensure_loaded()` lazy-retry for fonts built before SDL/TTF was ready. `Renderer.draw_text()` calls `font.ensure_loaded()` before use.
- **`Font.load()` ignored bold/italic**: now passes `self.bold, self.italic` to `gui_load_font`.
- **`"wheel"` vs `"scroll"` event mismatch**: C++ emits `"wheel"` but all 20+ widget scroll handlers check `"scroll"`. Fixed by normalising in `Window._process_event()` and `Window.run()`.
- **`ToastManager.__init__`**: required `window_w` arg but IDE called `ToastManager()` with no args → crash. Made `window_w` required but callers now pass `1600`.
- **`ToastManager.update()`**: `new_count` declared but never incremented → all toasts dropped every frame.
- **`ToastManager.show()`**: `self.toasts[self.count] = t` dict-style assignment on list. Changed to append.
- **`Widget.add_child()`**: `self.children[self.child_count] = widget` dict-style assignment on list. Fixed to append.
- **`Widget.remove_child()`**: `new_count` never incremented → child_count zeroed after any remove.
- **`Panel.add()`, `VBox.add()`, `HBox.add()`**: same dict-style index assignment bugs. All fixed to append.
- **`Card.handle_event()`**: no visibility guard — forwarded events to children even when hidden.
- **Per-frame Font allocations eliminated**: `Toast`, `Modal`/`Dialog`, `VideoPlayer`, `Image`, `ActivityBar` all cached fonts as instance attributes instead of constructing new Font objects every draw call.

### nython_ide.ny
- **`ToastManager(1600)`**: was `ToastManager()` — crash on `window_w` access.
- **Panel tab strip fonts**: `Font(...)` created every frame in `_draw_panel_tab_strip` → cached as `self._font_panel_tab/bold`.
- **Status bar fonts**: `Font(...)` created every frame in `_draw_status_bar` → cached as `self._font_status/bold`.

- **`enumerate(lst, start=N)` kwarg form fixed**: Root cause was two-part —
  (1) `NythonExecutor.hpp` kw_builtins set didn't include `"enumerate"`, so `start=` was silently dropped before reaching callBuiltin; (2) a duplicate `globals_["enumerate"]` in VirtualMachine.hpp (line ~4346) overwrote the correct version that had start-support. Both fixed: `enumerate` added to kw_builtins with `start` key extraction; both VM enumerate definitions updated with full positional + kwarg start support.
- **vm_audit27 added**: 84 tests covering the above plus *args/**kwargs, try/else, string .replace()/.count()/.join(), isinstance with inheritance, __repr__, callable classes (__call__), dict.items()/keys()/values(), chained comparisons, lambda multi-arg, map+filter, method chaining, sorted key=/reverse=, recursion, string %, dict.get(), `in` operator.

## Round 71 fixes (see `HANDOFF.md` §0b for full detail)

**Division, ruled**: `/` is always true division (float — `10 / 2 == 5.0`);
`//` and `\` are floor division (int — `10 // 2 == 10 \ 2 == 5`). This
resolves the "Integer `/` differs between engines" known limitation above —
it's no longer a divergence, the VM's `op_div()` was wrong and is fixed.

**Dead operators, now wired up on both engines** (verified with
`examples/vm_audit35.ny`, diffed interpreter-vs-VM):
- `instanceof` — alias for `is`.
- `===` / `!==` — strict equality/inequality (previously corrupted the VM
  stack as an unhandled NOP).
- `xor` / `^^` — logical xor (same previous VM stack corruption).
- `>>>=` — treated as `>>=` (Nython ints are arbitrary-width, no fixed sign
  bit to distinguish logical vs arithmetic shift).
- `~=` — bitwise-complement-assign: `x ~= y` means `x = ~y`.
- `++` / `--` postfix — now actually mutate on the VM (were a no-op there).
- `\` (RevDiv) — was unreachable at the lexer level; now floor-divides.

**New language constructs**:
- `enum Name: A, B, C` — members are ordinals (or explicit values); compiles
  to a bound name→value map on both engines.
- `namespace Name: ...` / `module Name: ...` (module is a pure alias) — now
  binds its own name on the interpreter (`ns.member` used to read `none`);
  now compiles on the VM at all (used to be a silently-dropped subtree).
- `interface Name: ...` + `class C implements Name` — interface now
  registers as a real type on both engines, so `implements` + `is`/
  `isinstance` chain-walking sees it (interpreter used to no-op interface
  declarations entirely; VM used to drop the subtree).
- `struct Point: x, y=0` — desugars at parse time to a class with a
  synthesized `__init__` that assigns each field via `self.field = field`.
- `new A()` / `new A` — construct an instance, distinct from `A` (the class
  value) and `A()` (call with no `new`, equivalent to `new A()` for a
  zero-arg constructor).

**Also fixed**: hex/octal/binary integer literals (`0xFF`/`0o17`/`0b1010`)
always evaluated to `0` on the VM (`std::stoll` stopping at the prefix
letter) — found incidentally, not part of the operator/keyword work above.

## Round 71b: IDE terminal command line

`nython_ide.ny`'s terminal panel now runs real commands instead of a
four-word stub. `lib/ide_commands.ny` (`:cmd` / `>expr` / `@agent`) and
`lib/ide_toolchain.ny` (the real popen-based compile/run bridge) are wired
into `NythonIDE.__init__`/`_term_run`. See `HANDOFF.md` §5.3 for the full
command list and what is still unverified (no headless keyboard injection
to exercise it end-to-end).

## Round 71c: operation-based undo and multi-cursor editing

Two more `HANDOFF.md` §5.3 modules wired into the shipped IDE:

- **`EditorBuffer` (`ide_editor.ny`) undo is now operation-based**, not a
  whole-document snapshot per keystroke. `insert_char`/`delete_char_back`/
  `insert_newline` record a handful of scalars and replay them through
  `_apply_inverse` (the same pop-apply-push technique `lib/gui_piecetable.
  ny`'s `PieceTable` demonstrates), instead of `nython_ide.ny` copying
  `buf.get_all_text()` before every character. Undo is now per-tab; `_redo()`
  (previously a hardcoded stub) actually works, bound to Ctrl+Y / Ctrl+Shift+Z.
- **Real multi-cursor editing** via `lib/ide_selection.ny`'s `SelectionModel`:
  Alt+Click / Ctrl+Alt+Down / Ctrl+Alt+Up add extra carets; typing/backspace/
  enter apply to all of them. The existing single-selection code is untouched.

See `HANDOFF.md` §5.3 for the full design rationale (why a full `PieceTable`
storage swap was rejected in favor of adopting its technique instead) and
documented limitations (multi-caret edits aren't one undo step; arrow keys
move only the primary caret).

## Round 72: nytorch gets real autograd, and a genuine VM closure bug

`lib/nytorch/autograd.ny` is new — a `Variable` class implementing actual
reverse-mode automatic differentiation (dynamic computation graph +
`.backward()` via reverse topological sort), scoped to scalars and 1D
tensors. Nothing in nytorch had this before; every optimizer in
`optimizers.ny` takes `grads` as an argument the caller must already have
computed by hand. `LinearVar` + `mse_loss` + `SGDVar` show it end to end —
`examples/vm_audit38.ny` trains one for 50 SGD steps and asserts the loss
collapses to `0.0`, verified against hand-derived AND numerical
(finite-difference) gradients on both engines.

Building it found two real bugs:
- **VM**: a closure stored in an instance attribute and invoked as
  `obj.attr()` (exactly the shape `out._backward_fn = _bw; ...;
  node._backward_fn()` uses) silently lost every captured variable —
  `vm_call_method`'s "bare FUNCTION held in an attribute" path called
  `exec_code(held.code, args, obj)` without `held.closure_env`, unlike every
  other call path. The interpreter never had this bug.
- **`activations.ny`**: `Tensor.relu()`/`.sigmoid()`/`.gelu()`/`.silu()`/
  `.swish()`/`.elu()`/`.softmax()` each call a bare global function of the
  *same name* as the method — which resolves back to the method itself, not
  the builtin (the interpreter's own `RecursionError` message names this
  exact gotcha). All seven were silently wrong on both engines; only
  `Tensor.tanh()` had already dodged it via its builtin's other name,
  `tanh_fn`.

Same round, follow-up: `LinearLayerVar`/`MLPVar`/`softmax_cross_entropy`/
`AdamVar` extend the engine to real multi-layer networks — `select()`/
`stack_vars()` stand in for a weight matrix nytorch doesn't have (n
independent `LinearVar` units combined into one vector), and
`examples/vm_audit39.ny` trains one on XOR (unsolvable by a single linear
layer) to loss 0.00046, byte-identical on both engines. See `HANDOFF.md`
§0c for full detail, including the init fix this needed and how it was
confirmed not to be a gradient bug first.

Also new: `lib/nytorch/agent_learn.ny`'s `CodingAgent` — an online-learning
agent built on the same autograd engine. Tokenises real Nython source with
the real keyword vocabulary, trains a small next-token-category model one
gradient step per adjacent pair (genuine online learning, not a deferred
batch retrain), and its perplexity on code it was never trained on
measurably improves after training on *different* code — real structural
generalisation, verified in `examples/vm_audit40.ny`. Building it surfaced
a real, quantified finding: `KnowledgeBase` is independently and
incompatibly defined **three times** inside `nytorch/` alone (plus a
fourth in `lib/aiagent.ny`) — import order silently picks whichever was
defined last, and a caller written against a different one gets `none`
back from every call instead of an error. Ten class names collide this way
across `nytorch/`. See `HANDOFF.md` §5.10 for the full list — not fixed
here, `agent_learn.ny` just doesn't add to it (`AgentKnowledge`, not
`KnowledgeBase`).

Final follow-up: real 2D matrix support. `Variable` gained optional
`rows`/`cols` shape metadata over its existing flat `.data`, and
`matmul`/`add_bias_row`/`select_row` are real batched matrix ops with
hand-verified backward rules — `LinearMatVar`/`MLPMatVar` are the
real-weight-matrix counterparts to `LinearLayerVar`/`MLPVar`, closing the
"real ND tensors... absent" gap as a pure Nython addition rather than a
native `tensor.cpp` change (too risky given ~15,000 existing lines depend
on the current representation). `examples/vm_audit41.ny` trains
`MLPMatVar([2,6,2])` on XOR with the whole batch going through each layer
as one matmul call, not four separate forward passes. Along the way, a
numerical-gradient-check false alarm (0.16 diff, traced to XOR's `(0,0)`
point landing exactly on relu's non-differentiable point at zero, given
zero-initialized bias) turned out not to be a bug — confirmed by printing
the pre-activations and by re-checking with inputs that avoid that one
coincidental point, which alone resolved it. See `HANDOFF.md` §0c for
the full trace.

## IDE Launch Fix (multi-session debug)

**Root cause 1 — LangWorkshopPanel defined after `var ide = NythonIDE()`**
`_build_layout()` tried to instantiate LangWorkshopPanel before the class was defined.
Fixed by moving LangWorkshopPanel before the launch block.

**Root cause 2 — Compound boolean expression with outer parens**
Line 762 of nython_ide.ny:
```python
# BROKEN — Nython parser can't handle (A and B) or C before a colon:
if (string_find(lower, "debug") >= 0 and string_find(lower, "session") >= 0) or string_find(lower, "breakpoint") >= 0:
```
The Nython parser sees `if (expr)` as complete, then hits `or` after `)` and throws
`SyntaxError: Unexpected token: :`. The error was caught silently by `evalImport()`'s
try/catch, making the IDE appear to "return immediately" with no output.
Fixed by removing the outer parentheses.

**Root cause 3 — Nython lexer `optimize()` out-of-bounds**
`optimize()` in Lexer.cpp accessed `tk[i+1]` without checking `i < nb-1`.
For large files (15K+ lines from combined imports), corrupted Dedent tokens.
Fixed: all `i < nb` guards changed to `i < nb-1` before any `tk[i+1]` access.

**Root cause 4 — Unicode characters in string literals**
Em-dashes (—), arrows (→), box-drawing chars (═─│), emoji in string literals
caused the Nython lexer to error. All replaced with ASCII equivalents.

**File split for parser depth limit:**
- `nython_ide.ny` — NythonIDE class + launch (imports the two below)
- `ide_editor.ny` — EditorBuffer, SyntaxHighlighter, RichEditor, OutputConsole
- `ide_workshop.ny` — LangWorkshopPanel
